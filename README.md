## Introduction
This repository contains scripts and instructions to enhance your Star Citizen gaming experience.
CIG LAUNCHER BACKEND SERVER THAT OVERWRITES AND FIXES FILES TO STABILIZE GAMELAY WITH SIMPLE HOTFIX ALREADY WORKING STABLE & WILL ALLOW LAN AND WLAN PLAY PLAY VIA RADMIN OR P2P IP-REMOTE CONNECTION

## Installation Steps
Follow these steps to set up your game:

### Step 1: Download RSI Launcher and Star Citizen Base Game
If you haven't already, download the RSI Launcher and Star Citizen base game using the launcher.

### Step 2: Run ciglauncher.bat
Run the `ciglauncher.bat` file and wait for the game to load.

### Step 3: Select Hotfix
In the game, navigate to the hotfix section as shown in the [Hotfix Reference Image](https://github.com/gamedev44/CIG-Client/blob/main/Hotfix%20Ref%20Image.png) and download the hotfix. Wait for the download to finish.

### Step 4: Locate Your Hotfix Files
The hotfix files will be located by default within `C:\Program Files\Roberts Space Industries`. Inside this folder, you should see a new folder called `StarCitizen`. Within the `StarCitizen` folder, there is another folder named `HOTFIX` containing two launchers:
- `StarCitizen_Launcher.exe` (Normal Launcher)
- `StarCitizen.exe` (Base Game in Bin64 folder)

### Step 5: Apply Easy Anti-Cheat (EAC) Workaround
1. Drag and drop `StarCitizen_Launcher.exe` into the `eac_Boot_Unstrapper.ps1` file.
2. Navigate to the `Bin64` folder and drag and drop `StarCitizen.exe` into the `EZ-CrashFix.ps1` file.

### Step 6: Re-run the Launcher
Once finished, re-run the launcher and **Do Not Verify Files**, as it will overwrite the hotfix mod and break the game.

### Step 7: Play and Enjoy the Game
Press play and enjoy your enhanced Star Citizen gaming experience!
